# Object Oriented Javascript

This series of lectures is meant to lead into the concepts of Object Oriented programming in Javascript. If you were a fan of OOP design patterns in Ruby, and wanted to see how to organize your code differently, these lectures are for you! Even if you aren't a huge fan of OOP, it'll be important to know going into Phase 4 and learning React, since you'll be expected to work with class syntax.
